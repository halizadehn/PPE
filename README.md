# Persuasion-Aware Explanations for Recommended Items

<p align="justify">This repository contains the implementation of our proposed approach for generating persuasive explanations in recommender systems (RSs). Our method constructs a persuasion profile for each user and generates persuasion-aware explanations for items recommended by various RS baselines. These explanations are evaluated from an explainability perspective using metrics such as model fidelity. We also incorporate the persuasiveness degree of each explanation to re-rank the recommendation list and assess the impact on recommendation utility. Experimental results on a real-world movie recommendation dataset show that our approach effectively generates persuasive explanations while also improving the utility of the recommendations. </p>

## Dataset 

<p align="justify"> We use the publicly available <a href="https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings">MovieTweetings</a> dataset, which uniquely links users to their Twitter IDs, allowing the extraction of personality traits through tweet analysis.  </p>
